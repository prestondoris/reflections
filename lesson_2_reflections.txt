What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You create a new git repository which will allow you to start making commits. Without initiallizing the repository you cannot make commits to track your changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is the middle ground for you to put everything together before making a commit to the repository. The working directory has all of your files, while the staging area will allow you to put any or all files together to be commited to the repository. This value offers the user to combine similar files that he/she believes to be logically connected in some way.
